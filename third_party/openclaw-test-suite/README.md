# openclaw-test-suite (vendored)

This repository vendors a small subset of https://github.com/getfoundry/openclaw-test-suite
to make this plugin's E2E tests runnable without a global install.

If you need to update it, prefer copying from upstream and keeping changes
minimal (local wrappers live under `test/oct/` + `scripts/`).
